            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There & Back Again: A Cross-Country Epic</h1><p>It's usually late February or early March when I load up my vehicle with tools of photographic wonder to embark on a journey from Asheville, NC into the unknown and across the U.S. Destination: Las Vegas. WPPI to be exact, where I have been an educator there since 2002.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8b9656e1adc0b7119ac419bcd54748f5ecfdf92.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brooklyn's Luft Coffee</h1><p>About five years ago, Blair Smith's twice-a-day coffee pitstop at NYC's Kaffe 1668 led to him striking up a friendship with barista Justin Rodriguez behind the counter. Smith then met mobile developer Aaron Sutula in a coffee seminar held by an espresso machine company. "I took a day off of work to go," remembers Sutula.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4cab8b5548c02525515410d6e85dd5580051ec9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Travel Smarter: The Backpack That Doubles as a Mobile Office</h1><p>Our pals at This is Ground recently launched a "smart" backpack that will make you feel like the coolest, most in-the-know traveler out there.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cuba on the Edge of Change</h1><p>at times can feel like a nation abandoned. The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
